## Assignment 1

### Exercise 1: Mask Discretization and Gaussian Filtering

This exercise involves discretizing convolution masks and applying them to images using OpenCV functions. The focus is on efficient computation using separable (1D) convolutions.

#### Part A: 1D Discrete Mask Computation

- **Objective**: Compute the 1D discrete masks of the Gaussian function and its first and second derivatives. The function allows the use of either a sigma value or a mask size.
- **Details**:
  - Test with sigma values: {1, 2.5, 5} and mask sizes: {5, 9, 15}.
  - Display the profile of the computed masks for verification.

#### Part B: Filtering and Convolution

- **Objective**: Apply convolutions to a grayscale image using Gaussian and its derivatives.
- **Details**:
  - Use the following sigma values: {0.75, 2, 5, 10, 15}.
  - Apply convolutions in both X and Y directions.
  - Display the results on the same canvas for comparison.

#### Part C: Laplacian of Gaussian

- **Objective**: Calculate the gradient and Laplacian of Gaussian using the `sepFilter2D()` function with \(\sigma = 3.0\).
- **Details**:
  - Compute gradients in X and Y directions, magnitude, and orientation.
  - The resulting image should highlight edges regardless of their orientation.

### Exercise 2: Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramids

#### Part A: Gaussian Pyramid

- **Objective**: Build a 4-level Gaussian pyramid using \(7 \times 7\) Gaussian masks.
- **Details**: Do not use the OpenCV `pyrUp()` and `pyrDown()` functions.

#### Part B: Laplacian Pyramid

- **Objective**: Build a 4-level Laplacian pyramid using the Gaussian pyramid.
  
#### Part C: Image Reconstruction

- **Objective**: Reconstruct the original image from the Laplacian pyramid.
- **Details**: Verify the accuracy of reconstruction by calculating the Euclidean norm of the difference between the original and reconstructed images.

### Exercise 3: Hybrid Images

Inspired by the paper "Hybrid Images" by Oliva et al. (2006), this exercise explores how distance affects the human visual system when perceiving an image. 

- **Objective**: Create a hybrid image by blending high-frequency components of one image with low-frequency components of another.
- **Details**:
  - Use Gaussian pyramids to control the frequency content of each image.
  - Experiment with different sigma values for filtering.

### Exercise 4: Pyramid Blending

This exercise focuses on creating a blended image by merging two images (e.g., an apple and an orange) using the Pyramid Blending technique.

- **Objective**: Create a horizontally merged image using pyramid blending.
- **Details**:
  - Use OpenCVâ€™s `pyrDown` and `pyrUp` functions.
  - Explain the process and the resulting blending effect in detail.
